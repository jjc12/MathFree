_If a bug is found, please submit an e-mail to jjc12@my.fsu.edu with the subject: "BUG: your_one_line_description_of_the_bug" and body: "your_longer_description_of_the_bug". This project is my priority so expect bugs to disappear **as soon as possible**_.

MathFree is a free, open-source C++ library that includes files written to manipulate the following mathematics-based
objects:

-Matrices (found in MatrixFree)

The **wiki** button that looks like an open book on the toolbar to the right provides a user guide to using these objects. If you believe you have an issue that cannot be solved by reading the guides, you may e-mail me at jjc12@my.fsu.edu with the subject: "ISSUE: your_one_line_description_of_the_issue" and body: "your_longer_description_of_the_issue".
