I still need to add the sections "Questions & Issues", "Documentation", "usage", and "license". 

# MathFree

MathFree is a free, open-source C++ library that includes files written to manipulate the following mathematics-based
objects:

-Matrices (found in MatrixFree)

The source code can be found at **SOME LINK HERE**.

*Note: <a href="https://github.com/jjc12/MathFree/wiki">Wiki: MathFree</a> provides a user guide for usage of the objects. Clicking the button that looks like an open book on the toolbar to the right will also take you there.*

### SquareMatrixFree

SquareMatrixFree is a class written to manipulate square (nxn) matrices.

##### Demonstration 

##### Features 

- Construct a matrix object of size nxn
- Read in values from a file or the console
- Add, subtract, and multiply a matrix with other matrices
- Add, subtract, multiply, and swap rows in a matrix
- Change or obtain individual values
- Obtain a submatrix
- Perform transformations on a 2x2 matrix
- Get the reduced (or row reduced) form
- Get a determinant
- Obtain an inverse
- Test whether the matrix is linearly independent or not
- Solve Ax = b

Updates (should go in wiki/updates):
