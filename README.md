# MathFree

MathFree is a free, open-source C++ library that includes files written to manipulate the following mathematics-based
objects:

-Matrices (found in MatrixFree)

Specifically, I still need to add the sections "demonstration" and "features" to each
class, along with the sections "Questions & Issues", "Documentation", "usage", and "license". 

If a bug is found, please submit an e-mail to jjc12@my.fsu.edu with a description of the bug. This project is my priority
so I will update bugs **as soon as possible**. With that being said, here is a brief description of the classes. A longer
description on how to use the class functions is specified in the **wiki** button on the toolbar to the right.
