# MathFree

MathFree is a free, open-source C++ library that includes files written to manipulate the following mathematics-based objects:

-Matrices (found in MatrixFree)

The first implementation of this library on GitHub was uploaded on March 19th, 2015. This implies it's new and the classes themselves may contain bugs that I'm not aware of. There is a lot to build on so expect improvements on this library and the GitHub page daily. Specifically, I still need to add the sections "demonstration" and "features" to each class, along with the sections "Questions & Issues", "Documentation", "usage", and "license". 

If a bug is found, please submit an e-mail to jjc12@my.fsu.edu with a description of the bug. This project is my priority so I will update bugs **as soon as possible**. With that being said, here is a brief description of the classes. A longer description on how to use the class functions is specified in the **wiki** button on the toolbar to the right.
